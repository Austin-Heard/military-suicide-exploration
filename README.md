# Initial Impressions and Questions
Do drugs and alcohol abuse appear to be contributing factors to military member and veteran suicides? Is there a strong difference in Veteran suicide rates versus Active member rates? Is there a certain age range most affected?

# Potential interests
Who is most affected and potentially needs more encouragement for help, in order to keep the mission going. Has there been a positive trend or negative trend, and can any attributing factors be spotted?
